This project analyzes stock data along with sentiment from news headlines, calculates key technical indicators, and visualizes the correlation between stock returns and news sentiment. The project uses several Python libraries including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and textblob for data analysis and visualization.
Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed on your system.

Install Dependencies
To get started, install the required dependencies by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Where requirements.txt contains the following dependencies:

Copy code
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
textblob
Alternatively, you can manually install them with:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy textblob
Usage
Data Files
Ensure you have the following data files in the data/ directory:

stock_symbol.csv: Historical stock data for each stock symbol you want to analyze. The file should contain the following columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.
news.csv: News data with Date and Headline columns containing news headlines and their corresponding dates.
Running the Script
To run the script and perform the analysis, simply execute:

bash
Copy code
python stock_analysis.py
This will process stock data for the symbols defined in the script, apply technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD), perform sentiment analysis on news headlines, merge the data, and visualize the results.

Output
The script will output the correlation between news sentiment and stock returns for each stock symbol.
Several plots will be generated:
Stock Returns vs. News Sentiment: A comparison of daily stock returns with news sentiment scores.
Stock Price and Technical Indicators: Stock price with the Simple Moving Average (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and MACD indicators.
